# Applied Data Science Specialization on Coursera
This repo contains all my work in the coursera specialization course I accomplished.
## All the code base and resources are taken from : [Applied Data Science on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python).
This repo contains all the programming assignments for 4/5 courses of the specialization

- Course 1: Introduction to Data Science in Python 
- Course 2: Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python - This repo doesn't contain any PA for this course
- Course 3: Applied Machine Learning in Python - **should be taken in order and prior to any other course in the specialization.** 

## After completing those,courses 4 and 5 can be taken in any order

- Course 4: Applied Text Mining in Python
- Course 5: Applied Social Network Analysis in Python
